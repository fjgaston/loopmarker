# loopmarker
a script to add marker tags to a wav file to make a loop (useful for samplerbox)

just run :
python2 loopmarker.py
and follow the instructions
Make a backup of your file first.

To be improved :
The script add a new marker every time it is used, instead it would be better to check for existing markers and replace them. 
It make this script unusable on files that already contains loop markers.
At the moment, the workaround is to make a backup of the wav file first
